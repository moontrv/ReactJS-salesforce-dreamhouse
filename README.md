# ReactJS-salesforce-dreamhouse

Original app on Heroku: https://dhprod-201911.herokuapp.com/

Heroku Connect was used to replicate (sync) Postgres DB to a Salesforce instance's DB.

This app uses the same REST endpoints from the original app, building with ReactJS.

To start: from the root project
